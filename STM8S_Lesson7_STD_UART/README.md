# NOTE: ALL PROJECT USE STM8S208C8T6 WITH DISCOVERY BOARD. CODE PROGRAMING: IAR Embedded Workbench
See detail in this project: https://github.com/IMetals/Template_IAR_STM8S.git

# Lesson 7: STD_STM8S_UART
## Introduce
The UARTs in the STM8S and STM8AF microcontroller families offer a flexible means of full-duplex data exchange with external equipment
requiring an industry standard NRZ asynchronous serial data format (UART mode).

## Main Feature
• Full duplex, asynchronous communications  
• NRZ standard format (Mark/Space)  
• High-precision baud rate generator system  
• Programmable data word length (8 or 9 bits)  
• Configurable stop bits (1 or 2)
